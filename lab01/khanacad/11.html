        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Transfer frozen puff pastry onto a piece of parchment paper. While puff pastry is still nearly frozen, use a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter to cut out circles of dough. Transfer cut circles onto the prepared baking sheet.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once as many circles are cut as possible, stack up 2 or 3 pieces of trimmings together and roll between parchment paper to the original thickness; punch out more circles. Again, chill dough in freezer as needed.

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add olive oil to a large deep skillet or braising dish, and set over medium-high heat. Transfer in sausage and poke 3 or 4 times on both sides with the tip of a knife. Cook until sausage is browned and just cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. The heat can be reduced down to medium after the sausage is turned over if the pan is getting too hot. Remove sausage to a plate and let cool. Transfer to refrigerator until needed.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add diced onion and salt to the skillet, and cook, stirring, until onion turns translucent and starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Add black pepper, chili flakes, oregano, and garlic, and a couple tablespoons of olive oil if there's not already enough fat in the pan. Cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute; pour in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil.
